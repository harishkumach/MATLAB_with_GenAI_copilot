# MATLAB_with_GenAI_copilot
AI as a MATLAB Co-Pilot: Accelerate your MATLAB projects with Generative AI

Abstract: 
The AI as a MATLAB Co-Pilot Competition invites engineering and science students, particularly those hesitant about extensive programming, to experience a swift approach to problem-solving using AI. This competition leverages the MATLAB AI Chat Playground, integrating GPT-4 to simplify coding tasks, allowing participants to focus on achieving results efficiently. With an initial tutorial for easy onboarding and subsequent challenges emphasizing quick and practical solutions, the event offers a welcoming platform for all proficiency levels to engage with AI and MATLAB in a streamlined, results-oriented context.
